# PyRobot Clones

<b>If you are planning to base a bot off of PyRobot, please, read this!</b>

I ask of you three things. These are not requirements, but requests.

1. Please credit PyRobot as the base while including a GitHub link to PyRobot! It is preferred to (cant think of anything pls wait)

2. If you add any new features to your clone, let me know about them! Opening an issue is the preferred way.

3. Please keep it open source! A GitHub repo is fine, just make sure to actively commit to it!
