instructions:
~~install everything on pypi~~

install `discord.py`, `urlgrabber` (i think), `pycurl` (probs dep for urlgrabber) and `pytz`

create `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pyrobot/config.json` (if you don't have a config_home it'll read from ~/.config)

fill it with this:

```
{
    "token":"<bot account token here>"
}
```

install [these fortunes](https://github.com/ncdulo/fortune-mod-mythical-linux) (or dont, but remember to disable the pr.fortune command, or modify it to your liking. pr.fortune doesnt work on windon't systems)

realise that i am not responsible for any shit that happens to your computer, check all the code you run, yada yada
